# English Speaking Practice Platform Supported by AI (AESP)

</div>

The AI English Speaking Practice (AESP) platform is engineered to enhance learners' oral proficiency through a hybrid model combining AI-driven conversation simulation with mentor-guided instruction.

In contrast to conventional pedagogical methods, which primarily focus on grammar and reading, AESP prioritizes interactive oral practice. The platform enables learners to engage in naturalistic conversations with an AI agent that delivers instantaneous, formative feedback on pronunciation, fluency, and grammatical accuracy.

Furthermore, the system supplements this AI interaction by connecting learners with human mentors for individualized feedback, specialized topic-based discussions, and comprehensive performance evaluations.

Leveraging AI-powered adaptive learning paths, AESP is specifically designed to mitigate common psychological barriers—such as shyness and fear of making mistakes—while simultaneously addressing the logistical challenge of limited access to speaking partners.
